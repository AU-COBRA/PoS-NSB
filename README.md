This repository contains a formalization of Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
Nakamoto-style blockchain (NSB). Assuming a synchronous network
with a static set of corrupted parties we prove chain growth,
chain quality, and common prefix.

## Building
The requirements can be installed via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):
```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq.8.11.2 coq-mathcomp-ssreflect.1.11.0 \
  coq-mathcomp-finmap coq-equations coq-record-update
```
Then, run `make clean; make` from the root folder. This will build all
the libraries and check all the proofs.

## Project Structure

The top-level structure consists of the following folders:

- `Protocol` - parameters for the development, implementation of the
  actual protocol and definition of a block tree.
- `Model` - definition of the network, global state, and definition of
  reachable global states.
- `Properties` - proved properties about the protocol. `CG.v` contains
  the chain growth theorem, `CQ.v` contains the chain quality theorem,
  and `CP.v` contains the common prefix theorem.
